# Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis

<p align="justify>We tend to study and investigate data in Data Science before doing any modeling or processing tasks. This allows you to find trends, summarize key data properties, or test a hypothesis. The traditional Exploratory data analysis does not directly analyze the geographical component of the information, but rather focuses on the interaction between variables and how they impact one another. Correlation statistics are frequently used to investigate the relationship between variables. </p>

<p align="justify>Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA), on the other hand, links a specific variable to a place while taking into consideration the values of the same variable in the vicinity. Spatial Autocorrelation is the term used to describe the approaches employed for this aim. The existence (or lack) of geographical fluctuations in a particular variable is described by spatial autocorrelation. </p>
