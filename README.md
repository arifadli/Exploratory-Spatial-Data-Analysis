# Spatial Analysis

**Motivation**
Waldo Tober’s first law of geography is that “Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” So, we would expect most geographic phenomena to exert a spatial autocorrelation. In population data, this is often the case as persons with similar characteristics tend to reside in similar neighborhoods for various reasons, including house prices, proximity to workplaces, and cultural factors.

**Tutorial objectives**
Run various measures of spatial correlation
Evaluate both global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation
Identify spatial clusters
